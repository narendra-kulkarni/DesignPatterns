Association
Association is a relationship where all objects have their own life cycle and there is no owner.
Let’s take an example of Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with single teacher and 
single student can associate with multiple teachers, but there is no ownership between the objects and
both have their own life cycle. Both can be created and deleted independently.

Aggregation
Aggregation is a specialized form of Association where all objects have their own life cycle, but there is
ownership and child objects can not belong to another parent object. Let’s take an example of Department
and teacher. A single teacher can not belong to multiple departments, but if we delete the department teacher
object will not be destroyed. We can think about it as a “has-a” relationship.

Composition
Composition is again specialized form of Aggregation and we can call this as a “death” relationship. 
It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child object does not have its life cycle and if parent object is deleted, 
all child objects will also be deleted. Let’s take again an example of relationship between House and Rooms. 
House can contain multiple rooms - there is no independent life of room and any room can not belong to two 
different houses. If we delete the house - room will automatically be deleted. Let’s take another example 
relationship between Questions and Options. Single questions can have multiple options and option can not 
belong to multiple questions. If we delete questions options will automatically be deleted.
