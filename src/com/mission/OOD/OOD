Designing of the object oriented classes generally happen through following steps
1) Problem statement / Understand the system (What it is?)
2) Use case analysis (How it works?)
3) Identify objects (both tangible and intangible)
4) Identify objects interactions
5) Identify attributes
6) Refine with hierarchy
7) Validate OO principles

At the end of the above steps, a decent class diagram can be obtained which serves as high level design of the system.


In low level design consider following things
1) Use of data structure
2) Running complexity of algorithms
