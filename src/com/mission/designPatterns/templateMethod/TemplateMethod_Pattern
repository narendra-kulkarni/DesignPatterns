Template method defines the structure of the algorithm and controls the different function calls within the
algorithm. When high level components (super classes) are dependent on lower level components (sub classes)
then template method pattern is useful.

There are two ways to use template method pattern
1) Using subclassing and delegating some of the behavior implementation to the sub classes.
   e.g. Beverage - Tea and Coffee
   
2) Using well known method of interfaces
   e.g. compareTo method of interface Comparable, which gets used in sorting algorithms.
   Here sorting method would be the template method and it depends on objects to implement
   the interface it is expecting. 
   
 Very useful pattern for framework creation.
